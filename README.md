This project displays a system,
where the requests generated by user within the home or outside the home can be
intelligently managed and controlled by Cloud based Services (AWS), using high
level functionalities like auto-discovery; auto-detection of devices; auto-
transmission of devices data; auto-switching tasks and so on and so forth. The
functions defined for this Remote Home access (RHA) system can be classified
into various service groups such as Monitoring, Controlling, Reporting,
Authenticating, Authorizing, Managing, logging and Temporary user
groups. As part of the RHA architecture, the connectivity between the Cloud and
the user application is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates so
that the infringement of user privacy is prevented.
Keywords: Internet of Things, RHA, SSL.
